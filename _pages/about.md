A PhD student doing research on the stability of renewable energy patterns throughout time. I am also a lecture lead / Mentor in **[Schulich Ignite](https://schulichignite.com/)** [^1]. In my free time, I contribute to open source projects such as **[STUMPY](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy)**[^2]. I am a never-stop-learning person :)
